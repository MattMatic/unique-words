# RegExp Filtering
The regular expression filter enables detection and extraction of words from specific lines.

Hint: Don't forget to enable the "Filter" checkbox to apply the filter!

Examples:
- `^\d+\s+(.*)` - Lines that start with digits, and spaces.
- `^([^\s]+)` - grab the first word, up to the first space character
